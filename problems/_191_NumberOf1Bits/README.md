https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/

# Description
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.
